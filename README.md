# ChatSystem
A menu driven program that supports instant messaging and file transfer using a binary method.The chat system first asks the users to enter their name. It will then proceed to display a menu option in which the user can choose between 3 options. The user can either type "m" if they wish to send a message, "f" if they wish to request a file from a particular user, or "x" if they wish to leave the chat system.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
The server side is first setup in order to accept incomming connections from multiple clients on a abritary port number the user assign.
